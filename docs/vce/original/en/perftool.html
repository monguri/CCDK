<h1>Description of Tuning Tools for Server</h1>
 
<p>
  To achieve a desired performance of a game server, in addition to writing an optimum code, you need to resolve external obstacles such as server settings and network configuration.  Even an optimum code cannot provide its performance, unless it is running under the optimum environment.  This section provides instructions for a suite of tools used to tune server performance under Linux.  
</p>


<h2>Memory Check </h2>
<p>
Insufficient memory results in the deterioration of performance due to frequent swapping.  Always check the sufficiency of memory.  
</p>



<h3>"free" Command</h3>
<pre>
% free
           total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1036176    1033184       2992      27144      66244      86308
-/+ buffers/cache:     880632     155544
Swap:      1052216     294136     758080
</pre>

<p>
This examines the amount of free memory.  
The above example illustrates a machine with frequent swapping due to 
insufficient memory. 
The "Mem" row shows the physical memory and the "Swap" row shows the amount of 
swap in KB.  The "free" column of "Mem" is 2992KB, which is too small for the 
"used" column of "Swap" 294136KB.  
Therefore it is obvious the kernel needs swapping.  The next example illustrates a machine with sufficient memory.  
</p>
<pre>
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        384312     382136       2176          0      23336      62856
-/+ buffers/cache:     295944      88368
Swap:        72252         80      72172
</pre>
<p>
 The "used" column of "Swap" 80KB is fairly small 
so kernel does not require swapping.  
</p>


<h3>File "/proc/interrupts"</h3>
<p>
  To examine the details of access to swap file system, 
refer to the contents of /proc/interrupts.  
See the following example.  
</p>
<pre>
              CPU0       CPU1       
       0:  193087070          0          XT-PIC  timer
       1:         16          2    IO-APIC-edge  keyboard
       2:          0          0          XT-PIC  cascade
       8:          1          0    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
      13:          1          0          XT-PIC  fpu
      14:          4          3    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
      18:   39802902   45878220   IO-APIC-level  eth0
      30:         17         28   IO-APIC-level  aic7xxx
      31:   23232546   25673945   IO-APIC-level  aacraid
      NMI:          0
      ERR:          0
</pre>
<p>
  This file shows how many times a CPU received interruptions from I/O devices. This machine has three kinds of device; ide0, aic7xxx, and aacraid. 
Only a RAID driver called aacraid is used.  
When you examine this file once every second, you will notice the interruption 
of aacraid is increased by a few dozen to a few hundred times.  
The larger the increase is, the more the disk access is done.  
On a machine with sufficient physical memory, if disk access is not particularly required, the interruption increases only by a few times. 
</p>

<h2>Network</h2>
<h3>"netstat" Command</h3>
<p>
  Use "netstat" command to examine the stagnation of input/output from network.  "netstat -tn" command is faster since it does not perform DNS reverse look up.  The following example shows the output of netstat performed on a server machine of online game.

<p>
   The "Recv-Q" column indicates stagnation of receive buffer and the "Send-Q" 
column indicates stagnation of send buffer.  When a send buffer exceeds 30KB, 
the receiving party is possibly not able to receive data. 
 When a receiving buffer is in the same situation, the capacity of the server 
process is usually over its limit.
</p>


<h2>Process</h2>
<h3>"top" Command</h3>
<p>
  The "top" command is a simple tool to check the machine usage under Linux.  
The following is a brief explanation of output items that are difficult to 
understand.  
</p>
<ul>
  <LI>"load average"<p>
      Three numbers indicate 
      "the average number processes waiting for execution" for past 1 minute, 
      5 minutes, and 15 minutes respectively.  
      "Processes waiting for execution" are the processes in a queue for each 
      CPU.  The processes in sleep at system call are not in this waiting queue.       Therefore, the load average will increase by approximately 1.0 
      if there is a process that requires CPU all the time.  
      If several CPUs are on SMP machine, 
      the same number of waiting queue is the same with the number of CPUs.  
      It displays the total number of processes in all of the queues; 
      if the load average is less than 2.0, 
      then CPUs are given to each process as requested.</p></li>
      

  <LI>Status of Process <p>
      In "STAT", "S" indicates sleep, 
      "R" indicates CPU in use, 
      "D" indicates processing I/O (mainly disk access), 
      "W" indicates a process is in swap page out, 
      "N" indicates low priority. </p></li>
</ul>

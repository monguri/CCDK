<h2>What is The Connection Switch?</h2>
<p>
The connection switch is the function to improve server transaction
process performance by locating a relay server (hereinafter, an "swp")
between an application client program and server program to undertake
all the cipher or packet compression processes.
It is just like a SSL decoder of the Web systems,
if a general Web application is concerned for instance.
VCE has this function built-in, and further, offers the function to
switch the server of a client-server connection to a different
server in the backend network, by connecting respective swp's and
servers in a round-robin system.    (Diagram)

<p>
By this function, an application that distributes that's
loads transparently to using more than one server
gains the following advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <LI>Structure of a client program can be simplified.</li>
  <LI>The error rate can be reduced drastically,
      since a data exchange, that occurs upon switching connection,
      is executed using a high-quality server network only. </li>
  <LI>The error rate may be further reduced,
      because no TCP handshake is exchanged upon reconnection. </li>
  <LI>Security improves for there lies a sort of
      gateway between a server and client.</li>
  <LI>May be used for the purpose of an easy
      "data exchange with locking",
      because the state buffer of circ_t is transferred as well.</li>
  <LI>Since swp is not dicated to specific application,
      more than one application can reuse it
      utilizing machine power efficiently. </li>
</ul>
<p>
On the other hands, we can find some weak points like:
</p>
<ul>
  <LI>On an extremely large scale, say over 1000 swp's or server machines,
      only a limited improvement of performance can be expected
      if you use this function as it is.
      Though, more practically, plural data centers are prepared for such
      large-scale contents. So this weak point cannot be a vital problem.</li>
  <LI>Since a few to 20 millisecond delay is added through relay,
      this function cannot be used by an application requiring a
      high-response of 10 to 20 milliseconds all the time.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 Probably, none of the above restrictions should be an obstacle for
areas other than online action games that requires an extraordinary response.
</p>

<h2>Mechanism of the Connection Switch</h2>
<p>
 The connection switch starts off calling the vce_circ_switch
function from a server program towards the circ_t. 
Once the vce_circ_switch function is invoked,
the server VCE library transmits a connection switch
request to swp, then the swp relays such request to a new server to move into,
without informing the client of it.
The new server then secures memory, and when successful,
returns the results to the swp.
3 handshakes are exchanged between the current server and new server
in order to cope with data reception from a client under the
switching process, guaranteeing that no packet losses should occur.
State transition through packet transmission is explained
as in the diagram below.
</p>
<BR>
<img src="../images/conn_sw_state.gif">
<BR>
<B>Figure:	Connection Switching State-flow</B>

<p>
swp reads a server's IP address and port information
in the form of a table (just like fstab of UNIX),
and establishes a connection to respective servers in compliance
with the configuration in the table.
Even if one of the servers is suddenly abnormally terminated,
connections other than the client connections currently connecting to
the down server will be reconnected after a certain period of time and
continue services, without being influenced by such termination. 
</p>
<P>
Each server has an individual ID that is strictly consistent with
the waiting port number.
The reason why ID and the port number are consistent is that when the number
of servers increases, debugging efficiency becomes dramatically higher
when UNIX standard analyzing tools such as "netstat -tn" is used,
rather than VCE.
Besides, plural servers having the same ID cannot exist on a single
"server table".
</p>
<p>
A client program connects to the frontend side of swp when attempting
to connect to a server, but in fact,
it is necessary to determine which server accepts such new connection.
The standard attached swp supports three algorithms;
"top", "sequential" and "random", to
determine which server will actually accept. 
</p>

<a name="howto"></a>
<h2>Procedure for Using the Connection Switch</h2>
<p>
An application using the connection switch is
put into operation as in the following procedure:
</p>

<ol>
  <LI>Start up respective servers with the connection switch API installed.</li>
  <LI>Start up all swp's and have them read a configuration table.</li>
</ol>


<a name="api"></a>
<h2>The Connection Switch API</h2>
<P>
  Coding with regard to the connection switch is only necessary to
the server side.
No additional code is required on the client side.
Furthermore, standard swp's can be used,
though original functions may be implemented by altering swproxy.c
that is included in the sample code.
The code logic in case of using the connection switch is as follows
(refer to autotest/swsv.c):
</p>
<pre>
vce_tcpcontext_create
vce_tcpcontext_set_circ_parser
vce_tcpcontext_set_circ_switchwatcher
vce_tcpcontext_set_circ_switchresultwatcher
vce_vec_init_mainserv
while(1){
  vce_heartbeat();
}
</pre>


<p>
The following functions, structures and enumeration types
are concerned with operation of the connection switch.
Refer to the reference manual for details of respective API functions.
</p>
<ul>
  <LI>SWENT_STATE Enumeration Type<p>
      Used by a data structure for storing the "server table" of the
      connection switch.
      It is actually used only within VCE, and will never
      be used for coding on an application level.</p></li>
  <LI>SWITCH_RESULT Enumeration Type<p>
	  This is the resultant code returned after a switch request from the
      switch destination server or from swp.
      Respective values have the following meanings:</p>
	  <ul>
		<LI>SWITCH_RESULT_OK : Terminated normally. 
            The current server may (must) release an applicable circ.</li>
		<LI>SWITCH_RESULT_NOTFOUND :A server with this particular ID
            does not exist on the server table.</li>
		<LI>SWITCH_RESULT_OFFLINE : A server with this ID is currently down.</li>
		<LI>SWITCH_RESULT_BAD_STATEBUF :
            Switch is not allowed for the state buffer sizes of a switch
            destination server and current server are different. </li>
		<LI>SWITCH_RESULT_CIRC_FULL :
            The switch destination server is full of circ's.</li>
		<LI>SWITCH_RESULT_CALLBACK_FAIL :
            switchwatcher of a switch destination server returned a
            negative value, meaning a switch was rejected. </li>
	  </ul>
	  If a switch fails, a switch source server should return some error to
      a client, or go on with the current process. </p></li>

  <LI>switchent_t Structure<p>
	  Used by swp(swproxy.c).
      The structure to store an entry to the server table.</p></li>
  <LI>vce_switchcontext_create Function<p>
      Used by swp. The structure to manage the connection state or to
      store configurations of connection switching.</p></li>
  <LI>vce_switchtable_read_from_file Function<p>
	  Used by swp to read the server table from a file onto an array of 
      the switchent_t structure. </p></li>
  <LI>vce_switchtable_show Function<p>
      Displays the contents of the server table.</p></li>
  <LI>vce_circ_switch Function<p>
      Switches a certain circ_t to another server, having appointed an ID.</p></li>
  <LI>vce_tcpcontext_set_circ_switchresultwatcher Function<p>
      Invoked when a switch source server completes switching operation.
      Check an argument of the SWITCH_RESULT enumeration type to confirm 
      whether there was an error or succeeded. </p></li>
  <LI>vce_tcpcontext_set_circ_switchwatcher Function<p>
      The circ_t, that a switch destination server attempted to switch,
      can be detected with this function.
      At the point this callback is invoked,
      the state buffer or attached data is checked, and may be rejected or
      otherwise treated if it does not comply with the reception conditions.
      When an on-line game is concerned for instance,
      it is easy to make a server that only
      allows level 10 or higher players to enter.</p></li>
</ul>


<a name="swp"></a>
<h2>swp Command</h2>

<p>
 The swp command is the standard connection switch relay program
attached to VCE that realizes the minimum functions.
Here is explained the startup options and input file
format of the swp command as follows: 
</p>

<h2>swp's Startup Options</h2>
<pre>
swp CONFIG_FILE SWITCHTABLE_FILE
</pre>
<p>
 Designate a configuration file as CONFIG_FILE.
Different files may be used for respective swp's,
or again the same files can be used as the configuration file.
In case a single swp runs for each machine, the same files should be used.
</p>

<p>
 A configuration file is in the format acceptable
by the vce_read_simple_config_file function of VCE.
The directives (commands) allowed to be written in a configuration file
are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <LI>verbose=0/1<p>
      Select 1 when designating the verbose mode of VCE, otherwise 0.
      Since setting this flag to 1 will lead to performance decrement
      and a growth in log file,
      it should be set to 0 when actually administrating
      a server on a commercial basis.</p></li>
  <LI>read_write_log=0/1<p>
      Select 1 when dumping all transmission and reception, otherwise 0. 
      Since setting this flag to 1 will lead to performance
      decrement and a growth in log file,
      it should be set to 0 when actually administrating
      a server on a commercial basis.</p></li>
  <LI>heartbeat_wait=0/1<p>
      The value fed to vce_heartbeat_wait_flag() by the SWP main loop.  
      Setting this to 0 will lead the CPU to be occupied 100%,
      but to the highest-speed response.
      Setting this to 1 will cause at most 100 millisecond delay per loop,
      though CPU consumption will be reduced to almost zero.
      This should be adjusted depending on the purpose of use.
      (The default value is 1)</p></li>
  <LI>frontend_bind_port=PORTNUMBER<p>
	  The frontend (a port that accepts a connection from a client) number.
      </p></li>
      
  <LI>frontend_cipher=none/blowfish/rijndael/twofish<p>
      Cipher algorithm to be used for communication with a client.
      Needless to say that setting up each swp the same will make it easier.
      </p></li>
　 <LI>frontend_cipher_key_length=NUMBER<p>
    The key length of a cipher key to be used for communication with a client.
    Note that values allowed to be used may vary
    depending on th cipher algorithm. </p></li>
  <LI>frontend_send_buffer_size=NUMBER<p>
      A transmission buffer for communication with a client.
      Normally takes a value from 16384 to 32768-
      it depends on the contents of the application.</p></li>
  <LI>frontend_recv_buffer_size=NUMBER<p>
      A receipt buffer for communication with a client.
      Normally takes valued from 16384 to 32768-
      it depends on the contents of application though.
      It is good to make this larger than a transmission buffer.
      </p></li>
  <LI>frontend_close_timeout=NUMBER<p>
      Disconnects automatically when no communication
      with a client is held for a certain period of time.
      Designated in seconds. </p></li>
  <LI>frontend_max_connection=NUMBER<p>
      The maximum number of TCP sessions a client is allowed to connect to 
      this swp. </p></li>
  <LI>admin_bind_port=NUMBER<p>
      The awaiting port number for a management program to establish a 
      connection.</p></li>
  <LI>admin_key_string=STRING<p>
      A password used by a management program to establish a connection. 
      (plain text)</p></li>
  <LI>server_max_connection=NUMBER<p>
      The maximum number of servers for an application.</p></li>
  <LI>server_send_buffer_size=NUMBER<p>
      A transmission buffer to be used for communication with a server.
      This needs to be far larger than the frontend-around 256k to 1M would be
      ideal.</p></li>
  <LI>server_recv_buffer_size=NUMBER<p>
      A reception buffer to be used for communication with a server.
      This needs to be far larger than the
      frontend-around 256k to 1M would be ideal.</p></li>
  <LI>server_close_timeout=NUMBER<p>
      Time that no communication with a server is held for,
      before a TCP session will be disconnected (in seconds).  </p></li>
  <LI>server_cipher=none/blowfish/rijndael/twofish<p>
      Cipher algorithm to be used for communication with a server.
      </p></li>
  <LI>server_cipher_key_length=NUMBER<p>
      The key length of cipher algorithm to be used
      for communication with server.</p></li>
  <LI>switch_reject_buf_size=NUMBER<p>
      The buffer size to guarantee that no data will be lost
      even if a client transmits data in the course of connection switching.
      It would be enough to secure the same extent as recvbuf of frontend.
      In case a client program only transmits a small packet at intervals,
      this buffer could be smaller than recvbuf of frontend.
      </p></li>
  <LI>accepter_policy=top/sequential/random<p>
      Select algorithm that determines which server is actually accepted 
      when a client establishes a connection to swp.
      In top mode, the first server in the server table is chosen.
      In sequential mode, servers are selected in order
      from top to bottom in the server table. In random mode,
      a server is selected randomly from the server table.
      </p></li>
  <LI>proc_file=PATH<p>
      Designates a path of the state file output at intervals.</p></li>
  <LI>proc_file_tmp=PATH<p>
      Designates a path of a temporary file for the state
      file output task - the state infromation output by the
      swp is temporarly saved in the
      temporary file designated by this PATH, then later renamed.</p></li>
  <LI>proc_interval=NUMBER<p>
      Designates an interval in which the state file is output
      (in seconds).</p></li>
</ul>

<BR><BR>
<p>
In SWITCHTABLE_FILE, a list of potential servers to be a switch
destination server is defined.
Just enter an IP address and port number pointed off with a comma,
without space or anything else, following "server=". It's that simple.
No port number overlap is allowed.
Since the port number is used as the server ID,
the port numbers must not overlap each other even if IP addresses differ.
</p>
<pre>
server=192.168.1.24,12345
server=192.168.1.24,12355
</pre>

<h2>swpadm Command</h2>
<p>
The swpadm command is a program for swp remote operation. 
A source code is attached as a sample program.
</p>

<h3>swpadm's Startup Options</h3>
<pre>
swpadm HOST PORT KEY_STRING PARAM0 PARAM1 PARAM2 ...
</pre>
<UL>
  <LI>HOST : An IP address of the machine where swp is in action.</li>
  <LI>PORT : admin_bind_port of swp. </li>
  <LI>KEY_STRING : A character string matching with admin_key_string of swp.</li>
  <LI>PARAM0 : 1st parameter (character string), compulsory. </li>
  <LI>PARAM1 : 2nd parameter(character string), may be omitted.</li>
</ul>
<p>
swpadm only has the function of transmitting the character string designated by PARAMn as is, and printing the character string returned from swp to the standard output.
</p>

<h2>What Can swpadm Do?</h2>
<P>
The ollowings are possiblfe with swpadm. 
Note that all of these functions must be implemented by the swp.
</p>

<ul>
  <LI>"shutdown NUMBER"<p>
	  Designate "shutdown" and a numerical value to PARAM0 and PARAM1  
      respectively, then kill swp after the designated seconds.
      </p></li>

  <LI>"accept PORT FLAG"<p>
	  Designates whether swp accepts connections with this client and 
      later.
      PORT is port number of the target server.
      Select 0 to not accept, or 1 to accept them as usual.
      The default value is 1. It's good to be executed before a shutdown.
      </p></li>

  <LI>"closeall PORT"<p>
	  Shuts down all client connections immediately.
      PORT is the target server's port number.</p></li>
  <LI>"ping"<p>
	  Check if the serer is alive or not.
      The server will return "pong" if alive.</p></li>

  <LI>"log"<p>
	  Outputs the operation state to the swp standard error output 
      (vce_errout).</p></li>

  <LI>"switch"<p>
	  Not implemented. 
      Switches an arbitrary client connection to the designated server.
      </p></li>
</ul>

<h1>Detailed Description of gen.rb </h1>
<p>
gen.rb is an auto function generator for protocol processing.  This tool easily implements RPC on VCE.  gen.rb reads a configuration file and then output C source code which can be compiled on Win32/UNIX and Ruby source code which can be used with Ruby.  It supports a network byte order so that it allows the communication between different processors and different languages.  The output of Java source code will be supported with future release.

<h2>Basic Concept</h2>
<p>
 In VCE, the basis of protocol processing is "remotely handles function calls"; gen.rb generates stub code required for this basis.  In other words, the entity of function is defined by this stub file and a switch function that actually calls a function from remote is also defined.  With TCPcontext, protocol processing is performed in three stages:
</p>
<ol>
  <LI>Data input from TCP connection or virtual circuit 
  <LI>Parser splits data into records 
  <LI>Call callback functions for each record 
</ol>
<p>
This switch function corresponds to callback functions called for each record.  Using gen.rb simplifies developing communication application without writing a complicated code such as processing data running in a socket per byte.  It also makes communication programming easy under multi-platform environment so a server by C and a client by Ruby can transparently communicate with each other.  In the future, Java will be supported in addition to C/C++ and Ruby. 
</p>

<a name="commandline"></a>
<h2>Command Line Option </h2>
<p>
The contents of configuration file can be overwritten by specifying a command line argument.  The name of configuration file is required.
</p>
<pre>
ruby gen.rb  configuration file name  [option]
The following options are available.  
--protocolname NAME            
--serverconnection conn|circ
--workbufsize SIZE
These options are the same with the options used in configuration file and overwrite the contents of configuration file if used as option.  
--noc  Do not output a stub file of C 
--nocpp  Do not output a stub file of C++ 
--noruby  Do not output a stub file of Ruby
These options do not take any arguments, and set the action of gen.rb. 
--identifier STRING
Change the identification used to identify commands in a configuration file 
from default "=" to a specified string.  
--vce_include_path PATH
Change the place of #include vce.h in output code.
--func_counter_type TYPE
Change the type of the call counter for callback function.  
</pre>

<a name="output"></a>
<h2>Output File Name</h2>
<p>
When gen.rb finishes successfully, the following six files will be created.
</p>

<h2>Input File Format</h2>
<p>
	  The format of input file can be anything like HTML, ASCII, or TEXT.  
          A line that begins with '=' is interpreted as a command line.  Using 
          this functionality, you can write description about protocol in HTML,
           and the same file can be used as a configuration file for gen.rb by 
          adding command lines as necessary.  
	  <BR><BR>
	  gen.rb parses an input file line by line; if it finds '=' at the 
          beginning of line, then retrieves a command and arguments the 
          following '=' and performs the operation of the command.  Any number 
          of spaces after '=' are perceived as a single space.  Also, a command
           line can be spread into lines by adding back slash at the end of the
           line.  '=' line must be written with a single command line, but it 
          can be written with multiple lines as follows: </p>
	  <pre>
	  =s2c 100 login ( int id, \
                     	  char password[100] )
	  </pre>
	  </li>

<a name="comment"></a>
<h2>Comment</h2>
<p>
      With the input file of gen.rb, all the text after '#' character will be
      ignored.
</p>
      
	  
<a name="commands"></a>
<h2>Command Line (directive)</h2>
<p>
A line begins with '=' is called a command line (directive line) and 
A command line (directive line) begins with '=' followed by command strings.  The following is a list of available commands.
</p>
<ul id="lib">
  <LI><B>protocolname NAME</B><p>
	  This specifies a protocol name.  
          Because a protocol name is used in various places such as function 
          name or file name, use strings that are clearly recognized as C 
          language's identification.  It is a good practice to add suffix 
          "proto" so that it is easily identified as a protocol function.  <BR>
          See the following example.  </p>
          <pre>
	  =protocolname toyproto
	  =protocolname gameproto
	  </pre></li>

  <LI><B>serverconnection CONNECTION_TYPE</B><p>
	  This command specifies the type of connection used by a server.  
          VCE implements a function that reduces the load of the server by using           packet vectorizer; write "circ" if you use packet vectorizer and 
          "conn" if you do not use packet vectorizer.    <BR>
          See the following example.</p>
	  <pre>
	  =serverconnection circ
	  =serverconnection conn
	  </pre></li>

  <LI><B>workbufsize SIZE</B><p>
	  This command specifies the size of work buffer that is used by gen.rb 
          when it internally sends data.  The maximum length of single record 
          for transmission is the value that is specified with this command 
          subtracting 1.  <BR>
          See the following example.  </p>
          <pre>
	  =workbufsize 8192
	  </pre><p>
	  The work buffer is created on stack so care should be taken for 
          sending a large record (a few M).  </p>

  <LI><B>version NUMBER</B><p>
	  This command specifies the version of protocol.  
	  An integer number can be specified in NUMBER. 
	  The specified version number can be retrieved as a return value of </p>
	  <pre>
	  int someproto_get_version( int *subv)
	  </pre><p>
	  function. See <a href="#version">version management</a>.</p></li>
	  
  <LI><B>vce_include_path PATH</B><p>
      The output code of gen.rb is dependent on vce.h; however, this directive 
      can change the file name that is given when you #include vce.h in output 
      code.  For instance, if you install VCE under /usr/local/vce, you may like       to specify as in the following example. </p>
      <pre>
      =vce_include_path /usr/local/vce/include/vce.h
      </pre></li>

  <LI><B>func_counter_type TYPE</B><p>
      A call counter for callback function is included in the output code of 
      gen.rb; this directive specifies the type of the counter.
      By default, the       type is VCEI64. <p>
      <pre>
      =func_counter_type int
      </pre>
      <p>Above example sets the type to int.  </p></li>
      
  <LI><B>idmax NUMBER</B><p>
	  This command specifies the maximum value of command ID of protocol.  
	  If the value is equal to or less than 255, 
          the internal data structure for identifying command becomes 1 byte.  
          If the value is greater than 255 and less than 65536, the internal 
          data structure for identifying command becomes 2 byte.  If the value 
          is greater than 65535, the internal data structure for identifying 
          command becomes 4 byte.  The smaller the value, the more traffic can 
          be saved.  By default, this value is 255.  With c2s or s2c directive,
           it causes an error if the value of ID is greater than idmax.</p></li>

  <LI><B>define IDENTIFIER EXPRESSION</B><p>
      This command defines a macro.  At present, it supports C only. </p>
      <pre>
      =define TEST 1
      </pre><p>
      Use as in the above shown example.
      This is an argument of function and mainly used to define a subscript of 
      array. </p>
      <pre>
      =define TEST_A(x) (x+1)
      </pre><p>
      Therefore, it cannot define a complex macro such as a macro with an 
      argument like the following example.  
      If you define this, </p>
      <pre>
      #define ??_IDENTIFIER EXPRESSION
      </pre><p>
      similar to the above will be defined in XXproto_sv.h and XXproto_cli.h.  
      By defining error codes and size constants that are frequently used in 
      protocol, clients and servers can share a constant definition file and the       development efficiency will be increased.  </p></li>
      
  <LI><B>enum ENUMTYPE IDENTIFIER [EXPRESSION]</B><p>
      Like define command, this defines enum of C.</p>   
      <pre>
      =enum HOGE INVALID_ARGUMENT -999
      =enum HOGE NOT_SUPPORTED
      </pre><p>
      If you define as shown above, and the protocol name is GAMEPROTO, </p>
      <pre>
      typedef enum {
          GAMEPROTO_INVALID_ARGUMENT=-999,
          GAMEPROTO_NOT_SUPPORTED,
      } GAMEPROTO_HOGE;
      </pre><p>
      an enum with a type of GAMEPROTO_HOGE is defined.  More than one ENUMTYPE 
      can be specified and in that case multiple definitions of enum are created      .  If a number (-?[0-9]+) is specified in EXPRESSION, then it is taken as
       a defined value.  If no value is specified, an enum with a default value
       is created.  </p></li>


  <LI><B>c2s ID FUNCNAME ( ARGDECL )<br>
	  s2c ID FUNCNAME ( ARGDECL )</B><p>
	  c2s and s2c define functions generated by gen.rb. 
	  c2s and s2c can be added up to idmax pieces in a single file.  <BR>
	  
	  c2s is an abbreviation of "client to server" and it defines a send 
          function on the client side and a receive function on the server side.           In other words, if you write a c2s directive, then a send function is
           added to 
           <code>protocol name_cli.c</code> 
          and a receive function call (not a definition) is added to 
           <code>protocol name_sv.c</code>. 
          The process upon receiving is defined by application so only a receive
           function call is performed.  
	  <BR>
	  Specify a message ID in <B>ID</B> with a number under idmax.  
          A message ID is used by client and server to identify a function, 
          and it is possible to handle up to idmax type of functions in total 
          for s2c and c2c.  This ID can be added manually to keep compatibility
           with the past protocol when a new function is added later. 
          Therefore, if you plan to add new functions in the future, making an 
          ID a jump number would be useful.
	  
	  Specify a function name in <B>FUNCNAME</B>.  As an identification of 
          C, proper strings must be used for a function name.  <BR>
          Specify arguments for each function in <B>ARGDECL</B>.  Following 
          types are available. </p>
	  <pre>
	  int i       : int type integer 
	  short i     : short type integer 
	  char i      : char type integer 
	  int a[100]  : int type array 
	  short a[100] : short type array 
	  char a[100]  : char type array 
	  stringarray a[100][100] : array of string [maximum number of string]
                                  [maximum number of characters for each string]
	  </pre><p>
	  A size must be specified when you specify an array.  It is required to
           avoid overflowing the work area that is reserved in output code of 
          gen.rb.  Be careful that the work area is created on a stack so 
          setting a large value may result in insufficient stack.  An order of 
          a few thousands is no problem.<BR>
          The size of array is a "maximum size" so a full amount of data would 
          not actually be transmitted.  For instance, if the first 10 byte of 
          char a[100] is used, only 10 byte is transmitted.  Also, if an array 
          is specified as an argument, an argument of int type that indicates 
          the number of elements in the array is added.  Its name is set to 
          variable name_len.    <BR><BR>
	  The following is an example of configuration and functions to be 
           generated.  someproto is a protocol name.  
      </p>  
	  <pre>
	  =s2c 100 login( int id, char passwd[20] )
	  C: int someproto_login_send( conn_t _c, int id, char *passwd, int passwd_len )
	  Ruby: someproto_login_send( Conn c, Fixnum id, String passwd )
	  
	  =c2s 101 sendbig( int bigdata[1000] )
	  C: int someproto_sendbig_send( conn_t _c, int *bigdata, int bigdata_len )
	  Ruby: someproto_sendbig_send( Conn c, Array ia )
	  </pre><p>
	  The maximum size of array is not a byte count but a number of elements. </p></li>
	  
</ul>



<a name="count"></a>
<h2>Command Counter</h2>
<p>
 gen.rb defines a function that counts how many times each command written in a protocol configuration is sent/received.  When "login" command is sent to a server from a client, the following function is defined on the client side,  </p>
<pre>
C: VCEI64 someproto_get_login_send_count(void)
Ruby: someproto_get_login_send_count()
</pre><p>
and the following function is defined on the server side.  </p>
<pre>
VCEI64 someproto_get_login_recv_count(void)
Ruby: someproto_get_login_recv_count()
</pre><p>
By default, the type of return value is VCEI64, but it can be changed 
by --func_counter_type argument or =func_counter_type directive.  </p>


<a name="version"></a>
<h2>Version Management</h2>
<p>
Protocols are continuously changing so the version management is indispensable.  With gen.rb, we propose managing the version numbers of protocol with two values.  One is a version number that is specified by a programmer, and the other is a sub version number that is retrieved by hashing the contents of the configuration file and it can be used as a strict "finger print of contents".  The version number specified by a programmer is set with the following directive.
</p>
<pre>
=version
</pre>
<p>
This is called as a major-version.  Both sub version and major version can be retrieved by the following function.
</p>
<pre>
C(server): int someproto_sv_get_version(int *subv )
C(client): int someproto_cli_get_version(int *subv )
Ruby(server): someproto_sv_get_version()
Ruby(client): someproto_cli_get_version() 
</pre>
<p>
This function returns the major version that a programmer specified in a configuration file and returns the sub version for the int value directed by subv pointer.   A sub version is used only when a strict match of protocol is required..  Usually it can be ignored by specifying NULL for subv.  If "=version" is not included in a configuration file, this function always returns -1 as a major version number.  With Ruby version method, it always returns an array with two elements; 0th element indicates a major version and 1st element indicates a sub version.

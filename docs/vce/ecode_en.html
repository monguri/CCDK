<h1>VCE Error Codes and Error Messages </h1>
<p>
There are two methods to identify an error in VCE; getting an error number by the vce_get_last_error function, and referring to the output strings in the error log (vce_errout).  These codes are explained below.
</p>


<h2>VCE Error Codes</h2>
<p>
The following list contains all VCE error codes.  New error codes may be added later, but existing ones will not be deleted nor modified, so the following codes are valid for future releases.  
<BR>
The following list refers to the contents of vce.h.</p>

<h2>VCE Error Logs </h2>
<p>
There are four kinds of messages stored in a log by VCE: Fatal, Warning, Bug, and Note.  All messages are numbered; Fatal error messages start from 1000, Warning messages start from 4000, Bug messages start from 7000, and Note messages start from 10000.  These nmbers will increase in future versions of VCE, but existing messages will not be deleted nor modified (their detailed descriptions may be changed).  The following messages are for VCEgg 0.2.  These are defined as macros by vce.h.  <BR>
Because descriptions of these messages may be changed in the future, always use the error number such as "Fatal: 1101" rather than the English description as a clue to analyze a log with backup and administration tools.
</p>

<h2>Fatal Error Messages </h2>
<p>
Fatal error messages are generally caused by the incorrect usage of VCE by an application, or are due to the insufficient configuration of the operating system (problem with ports, free memory, permissions issues, etc.)  Errors can be resolved by carefully tracking down the cause through the below messages.

<h3>Warning Messages </h3>
<p>
Warning messages indicate that the exhaustion of resource or the deterioration of performance may be experienced in the future even though VCE continues working.  It is recommended to avoid warning messages as much as possible by tuning VCE's configuration.

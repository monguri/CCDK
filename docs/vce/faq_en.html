<h1>VCE FAQ</h1>

<OL id="lib">

  <LI>Cannot establish more than a thousand of TCP connection.
          <p>If you initialize VCE with a vce_initialize function, 
          the maximum number of connection is set to 1000.  
          Initialize by using the vce_initialize_limited function 
          and specify a large number for max_conn member of vce_limit_t.</p></li>
      
  <LI>Calling vce_initialize reserves memory for a few MB. 
	  <p>You can decrease the amount of memory usage as much as possible 
          with the vce_initialize_limited function instead of the vce_initialize           function. 
          See vce_initialize_limited function reference for an instruction.</p></li>
	
  <LI>Delay simulator (vce_tcpcontext_set_read_delay) does not work.
	  <p>See "Cannot call a parser". </p></li>
	  
  <LI>Cannot call a parser.
	  <p>If you find nothing wrong with a source, but a parser is not called, 
          several causes are considered to be causing the problem.  </p>
      <ul>
        <LI>The order of calling tcpcontext_connect function and configuring 
            parser. <p>
            Usually this problem happens when you call a function 
            (ex. vce_tcpcontext_set_conn_parser ) that configures tcpcontext_t 
            after vce_tcpcontext_connect.  
            A process such as vce_tcpcontext_connect that assigns a new 
            connection copies the configuration of tcpcontext_t upon assignment.             For a detailed information, see vce_tcpcontext_connect and 
            vce_tcpcontext_create manual.</p></li>
        <LI>Using gen.rb with p2p application <p>
            With p2p application, the same program can be a client and a server,
             and sometimes it shares a protocol with a single protocol 
            configuration file.  
            In this case, if you write "=c2s" and "=s2c" the other way around, 
            calling a protocol function does not reach the destination party.</p>
            <pre>
            You should have written  
            =c2s hello ( char name[100] )
            =s2c hello_reply ( char answer[100] )
            but you made a mistake and wrote 
            =s2c hello ( char name[100] )
            =c2s hello_reply ( char answer[100] )
            </pre>
            <p>Check the protocol file again.  </p></li>
      </UL>
           
  <LI>While using encryption, acceptwatcher is not called. 
	  <p>If you call vce_tcpcontext_connect from client and then call 
          vce_conn_close after a short while (like 10ms), 
          the packet exchange of SSL is terminated before it finishes so 
          acceptwatcher at server side will not be called. 
          Initializing SSL requires a packet exchange several times. 
          To examine if SSL packet exchange has finished, use the following. </p>
	  <pre>
	  if( vce_conn_writable(c) &gt; 0 )
	  </pre></li>
	  
  <LI>vce_heartbeat causes an infinite recursion 
	  <p>You have called vce_heartbeat in a callback function 
          (parser, acceptwatcher, closewatcher, etc.) that is called from 
          vce_heartbeat. 
          To fix the problem, modify the code.  </p></li>
	  
  <LI>Does increasing a write buffer and/or read buffer bring stability? 
	  <p>Depends on the application, but it usually makes it more stable. 
          In VCE, when 100 bytes are needed to be written in a buffer 
          when only 50 bytes are available, then it does not write just 50 bytes           but causes an error. 
          This is based on the following concepts: </p>
	  <UL>
		<LI>"A problem caused by perished data is worse than having 
                    no data."  </li>
                <LI>"Otherwise it does not make sense to use buffer." </li>
                <LI>"Handling an error is easier by protocol for each record."</li>
      </UL>
	  <p>Generally some applications disconnect right away 
          when this error occurs because it can be considered that
          "a write buffer is full because a reading is working insufficiently".</p></li>
	  
  <LI>Received an error message that is not found in the error message list.
	  <p>Among the messages displayed by VCE, 
          only the messages with fixed specification are added 
          to the error message list.  
          A message not found in the error message list would be added 
          to the list in the future version.</p></li>
      
  <LI>Memory leak was found with the memory leak check program.
	  <p>You probably forgot the vce_tcpcontext_cleanup and vce_finalize.  
          These functions free the memory used by tcpcontext_t and VCE itself.            Take care that the vce_finalize function does not free memory used by
           tcpcontext_t (both functions must be called properly). 
          Also, some requires calling the cleanup function. </p></li>

  <LI>Linking vcewin32_x_y_zz.lib results in a link error.
	  <p>vcewin32 is dependent on the winsock2 library provided by Microsoft. 
          Dependent means it refers symbols.  
          Therefore, when you compile an application, you need to add 
          <B>ws2_32.lib</B> to the library you link to.  </p></li>
	  
  <LI> Compatibility with multi-thread application on Windows<p>
	  VCEwin32 supports multi-thread environment under Win32 environment. 

	   Use a library named like "vcewin32_0_3_12mt.lib", 
           then you can properly compile when you use a multi-thread version C 
           library (in VC, /MTd option). 
           If you use single-thread C library (in VC, /MLd), link a library name            like "vcewin32_0_3_12.lib".<BR> 
           However, since VCE is not thread safe, calling VCE function 
           from two or more threads should be avoided. 
           Typically, making a thread "for network", and calling 
           the transmitting function and heartbeat of VCE only in the thread 
           are mounted.</p></li>
 
  <LI>Is it possible not to use VCE on either the client or the server? <p>
	  For instance, use VCE for the client and an ordinary program 
          for the server, or the other way around. 
          It is very easy especially if you do not use an encryption server 
          or a relay server (the other way around is very difficult).  
          Typical example is when the high load server only uses the VCE relay
           server, and the client carried out an ordinary socket programming. 
          For instance, this case applies to building SMTP server with VCE 
          and also you can easily create client with VCE.  
          The configuration must be selected if you can not use VCE 
          on a client platform, such as cell phone.</p></li>

  <LI>Warning message for SO_SNDLOWAT
	  <p>VCE uses a socket option "SO_SNDLOWAT".  
          If you use VCE under Linux kernel 2.2 or 2.4, 
          this option is not available. 
          When a new connection is accepted and when a connection is established           to a remote host, a warning message "Cannot configure SO_SNDLOWAT 
          (Protocol not available)" is displayed (only with a verbose mode). 
          With FreeBSD release 4.1 and above, 
          this warning message is not displayed.</p></li>  

  <LI>vce_tcpcontext_create function returns EINVAL.
	  <p>If vce_tcpcontext_create returns EINVAL and is unable to initialize 
          tcpcontext with various arguments settings, this is mostly because of
           a missing vce_initialize() function call.</p></li>  

  <LI>When using Ruby/VCE, <BR> 
          "no implicit conversion from ..." message is displayed upon receiving 
          data is indicated.<p>  
          The value (handled as a return value) of the last expression of 
          Proc does not return an integer at a callback process 
          (ex. acceptwatcher, parser, closewatcher, etc.) that passes an object
           for Proc.  
          With Ruby/VCE, this return value of callback Proc is used to identify
           an error of protocol.  </p></li>

  <LI>How do I voluntary specify a timeout when I use a circ_t.<p>
      See vce_circ_set_timeout function reference.  </p></li>

  <LI>strace goes SIGSEGV<p>
          When you run a program linked to VCE on strace and the maximum number
           of connection is approximately greater than 1020, 
          then strase itself goes SIGSEGV. 
          The cause of this problem is that you changed FD_SETSIZE to 65536 and
           compiled VCE, but the strace used to execute a program is compiled 
          with FD_SETSIZE = 1024. 
          When you use strace command, set the maximum number of connection at 
          below 1000. 
          We assume you do not need many connections for debugging with strace.
           However, if you need strace with 65535 for production, 
          CommunityEngine Inc. can provide you customized version of strace 
          (of course, you can create your own strace by referring to 
          <a href="linuxtune.html">Linux tune</a>.)  </p></li>
      
  <LI>Although a connection has been closed, it is not released right away. <p>          When you close a connection with a vce_conn_close function, 
          if data remain in the send buffer of the closed connection, 
          VCE will attempt sending the remaining data until the default timeout
           (an argument of vce_tcpcontext_create function) expires.  
          If you do not need to take care of this problem, 
          for instance a client side program, use vce_conn_set_timeout and 
          specify the timeout value to zero or closet to zero for applicable 
          connections so that a connection is released right away.  
          For detailed information, see vce_conn_close function reference.  
          The timeout for a connection established again by connect/accept is 
          set back to the default value.  </p></li>
      
  <LI>A callback function is called only once for a single heartbeat. <p>
          This is a VCE specification. 
          It is because VCE's main objective is to develop a server 
          that provides service to many clients concurrently.  
          This can be an obstacle so 
          vce_tcpcontext_set_conn_call_parser_per_heartbeat is provided to 
          adjust the number of times. </p>

  <LI>Can multi-byte strings be processed with a group of functions in the text category? <p>
          In case of Japanese, it can be processed if the target text is in EUC.           The text category processes all inputs in byte unit.  
          When you directly process multi-byte strings such as Japanese and 
          Chinese, you will need a text processing routine for each language.  
          In being aware that game servers will be used in a multilingual 
          environment, CommunityEngine Inc. is planning to provide a text 
          processing engine especially for Japanese in future versions.</p></li>

  <LI>Calling vce_vecprotocol_unparser_* failed.<p>
          If the size of write buffer for relay server is less than 32768 
          when tcpcontext_create is executed, it may fail and return 
          VCE_EMORESENDBUF. 
          This problem is solved by setting a larger buffer size. 
          Typically, 1MB or larger buffer is needed.  </p>

  <LI>Performance is improved by calling vce_heartbeat several times. <p>
          Even if you set vce_tcpcontext_set_conn_call_parser_per_heartbeat to 
          the maximum value (ex 10000), calling vce_heratbeat several times 
          rather than once may improve the performance of a callback.  
          This is because VCE acquires only 32KB per single connection for 
          a single vce_heartbeat. 
          This is in consideration that the load for each connection should be 
          uniform for a server program. 
          However, this may deteriorate performance when there are too many 
          small queries or performing a bulk transmission. 
          In this case, call vce_heartbeat successively for several times.</p></li>

  <LI>What is a "bind error" (VCE_EBIND)"?<p>
          Under UNIX (Linux), to keep up a server using TCP/IP, server processes           must occupy 65536 "TCP ports" from #0 to #65535. 
          Use a system called "bind" to occupy those ports (with VCE's C API, 
          "bind" is executed when the vce_tcpcontext_create function is called).           Therefore, when a server process that uses a #2000 port is working 
          already, if another process that uses a #2000 port tries to start, 
          the vce_tcpcontext_create function returns a VCE_EBIND error, 
          which means a process was unable to start since the port is already 
          bound.  </p></li>
      
  <LI>The method of the success judging when connecting from clients is not known. <p>
          Refer to <a href="connect.html"> Connection from VCE clients</a></p></li>
        
  <LI>How to make file transfer programs and streaming applications using VCE?<p>

          Not only the VCE, it is desirable to carry out the data demand of 
          client initiative, but not one-way data transmission by server like 
          HTTP.
          The client initiative means mounting the server in order to carry out            the request message from a client faithfully; for example, 
          if the client request "data of 1KB", the server returns "data of 1KB".          Each time the client transmits this request, a counter increases only           one, and whenever data returns, it decreases one. 
          And if the frequency of the transmission demand is adjusted to keep 
          the value of this counter 4 or less, only 4KB will not save on 
          a network at the maximum. 
          By carrying out like this, the server load of the application 
          which tends to require load for a server memory like a file transfer 
          is reduced sharply, and also the zone of the server side can be used 
          evenly. </p></li>

  <LI>What is VCEI64 data type?<p>
      typedef'ed as "long long" in Linux and PS2.
      typedef'ed as "__int64" in win32.
      This data type is defined by VCE to use 64bit longer integer
      when calling VCE functions.</p></li>
      
  <LI>Unneeded log output "received data..." is printed out on PS2<p>
      in PS2 sce-libnet environment, VCE prints out some log lines
      by default. To stop this, you will execute following code tip:</p>
      <pre>
      extern int rinsock_do_errout;
      rinsock_do_errout = 1;
      </pre></li>
